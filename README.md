# ICP Quantum Tunneling
ICP Quantum Tunneling is a fork of PhET's [Quantum Tunneling and Wave Packets](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/legacy/quantum-tunneling) simulation. Quantum Tunneling and Wave Packets simulates the movement of quantum particles through barriers (quantum tunneling). The original project is not being maintained anymore. This fork adds new features to the original application such as viewable probability density values and the possibility of exporting the simulation data.
